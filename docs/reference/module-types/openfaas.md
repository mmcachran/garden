# `openfaas` Module Type

## Description

Deploy a [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) function using Garden. Requires the `openfaas` provider
to be configured.

Below is the full schema reference. For an introduction to configuring Garden modules, please look at our [Configuration
guide](../../using-garden/configuration-overview.md).

The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

`openfaas` modules also export values that are available in template strings. See the [Outputs](#outputs) section below for details.

## Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
# The schema version of this config (currently not used).
apiVersion: garden.io/v0

kind: Module

# The type of this module.
type:

# The name of this module.
name:

# Specify how to build the module. Note that plugins may define additional keys on this object.
build:
  # A list of modules that must be built before this module is built.
  dependencies:
    - # Module name to build ahead of this module.
      name:

      # Specify one or more files or directories to copy from the built dependency to this module.
      copy:
        - # POSIX-style path or filename of the directory or file(s) to copy to the target.
          source:

          # POSIX-style path or filename to copy the directory or file(s), relative to the build directory.
          # Defaults to to same as source path.
          target: ''

  # Maximum time in seconds to wait for build to finish.
  timeout: 1200

# A description of the module.
description:

# Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules
# based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: \${environment.name == "prod"}`).
# This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.
#
# Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also
# means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which
# case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).
#
# If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will
# automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's
# service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make
# sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.
disabled: false

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that
# do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to
# filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source
# tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files
# guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for
# details.
#
# Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.
include:

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match these
# paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events,
# and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include`
# field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration
# Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories)
# for details.
#
# Unlike the `modules.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and
# directories are watched for changes. Use the project `modules.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large
# directories that should not be watched for changes.
exclude:

# A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific
# branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>
#
# Garden will import the repository source code into this module, but read the module's config from the local
# garden.yml file.
repositoryUrl:

# When false, disables pushing this module to remote registries.
allowPublish: true

# A list of files to write to the module directory when resolving this module. This is useful to automatically
# generate (and template) any supporting files needed for the module.
generateFiles:
  - # POSIX-style filename to read the source file contents from, relative to the path of the module (or the
    # ModuleTemplate configuration file if one is being applied).
    # This file may contain template strings, much like any other field in the configuration.
    sourcePath:

    # POSIX-style filename to write the resolved file contents to, relative to the path of the module source directory
    # (for remote modules this means the root of the module repository, otherwise the directory of the module
    # configuration).
    #
    # Note that any existing file with the same name will be overwritten. If the path contains one or more
    # directories, they will be automatically created if missing.
    targetPath:

    # By default, Garden will attempt to resolve any Garden template strings in source files. Set this to false to
    # skip resolving template strings. Note that this does not apply when setting the `value` field, since that's
    # resolved earlier when parsing the configuration.
    resolveTemplates: true

    # The desired file contents as a string.
    value:

# A map of variables scoped to this particular module. These are resolved before any other parts of the module
# configuration and take precedence over project-scoped variables. They may reference project-scoped variables, and
# generally use any template strings normally allowed when resolving modules.
variables:

# Specify a path (relative to the module root) to a file containing variables, that we apply on top of the
# module-level `variables` field.
#
# The format of the files is determined by the configured file's extension:
#
# * `.env` - Standard "dotenv" format, as defined by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
# * `.yaml`/`.yml` - YAML. The file must consist of a YAML document, which must be a map (dictionary). Keys may
# contain any value type.
# * `.json` - JSON. Must contain a single JSON _object_ (not an array).
#
# _NOTE: The default varfile format will change to YAML in Garden v0.13, since YAML allows for definition of nested
# objects and arrays._
#
# To use different module-level varfiles in different environments, you can template in the environment name
# to the varfile name, e.g. `varfile: "my-module.\$\{environment.name\}.env` (this assumes that the corresponding
# varfiles exist).
varfile:

# The names of services/functions that this function depends on at runtime.
dependencies: []

# Key/value map of environment variables. Keys must be valid POSIX environment variable names (must not start with
# `GARDEN`) and values must be primitives.
env: {}

# Specify which directory under the module contains the handler file/function.
handler: .

# The image name to use for the built OpenFaaS container (defaults to the module name)
image:

# The OpenFaaS language template to use to build this function.
lang:

# A list of tests to run in the module.
tests:
  - # The name of the test.
    name:

    # The names of any services that must be running, and the names of any tasks that must be executed, before the
    # test is run.

    # enable/disable tests based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g.

    # specific environments, e.g. only during CI.
    disabled: false

    # Maximum duration (in seconds) of the test run.
    timeout: null

    # The command to run in the module build context in order to test it.

Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.
